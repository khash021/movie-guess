# Movie Guess

This is a Java program as a part of my learning process.

It will get the movie titles from a txt file, and extract the movies titles from it.
Then it will randomly select a title, and the goal of the game is for the user to guess the 
title before running out of guesse.
The user will chose the difficulty of the game (number of guesses the get) prior to starting
the game.

This is a work in progress and I will be updating it periodically.
